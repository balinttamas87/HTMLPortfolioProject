Create the Page Header
At the top of our page, we'll want to create an element with a class of header for us to add some information about ourselves.

Header Text
Inside of our .header element, create an h1 tag with your name in it. This is your portfolio, so it makes sense for your name to have the most prominence.

Job Title
Also inside the .header element, add a h2 tag with a job title (ie. "software developer", or "web designer", or "maker of things", etc).

The Tagline Element
Next, create a new element that has a CSS class called tagline. In this element you'll be giving a little more information about yourself.

A Little About You
Inside the .tagline element, create a h3 tag inviting the visitor to learn more about you (ie. "Learn More About Me", or "Here's What I Do", etc). Also add an introductory paragraph with more information about yourself, including what things you're passionate about, programming languages you enjoy writing in, etc.

The Skills Element
Next, we'll create a place to list out our current skills by creating an element with a class of skills. In here we'll be listing out what we already know.

Skills Content
Inside the .skills element, create a h3 tag inviting the user to learn more about your skills (ie. "my skills"). Also add a paragraph tag describing your skills (ie. "I enjoy writing front-end code with these technologies").

List of Skills
Inside the .skills element, create a new ul which will be a list of of your skills. In here, add 3 skills you currently possess. HTML must be one of these skills.

The Contact Element
The last section of our page will give people a way to contact us. Create a wrapper element for this area and give it a class of contact.

Contact Copy
Inside the .contact element, create a h3 tag inviting the user to contact you (ie. "contact me", or "drop me a line"). Also add a paragraph tag describing how people can contact you.

Contact Link
Lastly, we just need a way for people to get in touch with us! In the paragraph you created, add an anchor tag (an <a> element) pointing people to a place where they can get more information about you (ie. Twitter, LinkedIn, Github, etc).
